        <p>
            You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Five days on the freeway<br>
Riding shotgun with you (yeah, yeah)<br>
Two hearts in the fast lane<br>
We had big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)<br>
Playing Sweet Child O' Mine<br>
And I still feel that line<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Hey, it's been too long<br>
Too long to go, my love<br>
Where did we go wrong?<br>
Too late to turn around<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Hey, it's been too long<br>
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Hey, it's been too long<br>
Some days I can feel it<br>
But the feeling ain't all blue<br>
You got me believing<br>
One day you gotta come through<br>
Lost in these city lights<br>
'Cause I can't sleep tonight<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Hey, it's been too long<br>
Too long to go, my love<br>
Where did we go wrong?<br>
Too late to turn around<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Hey, it's been too long<br>
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
Where are you now?<br>
